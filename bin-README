To flash the app onto the dev board, you need "esptool" program.
On linux, it is going to be a package named "esptool". On other systems,
and on linux distros that don't provide such package, get Python
(>= 3.10) and use "pip install esptool".

Then, run:

python -m esptool -p /dev/ttyACM0 --chip esp32s3 -b 460800 \
	--before default_reset --after hard_reset \
	write_flash "@flash_args"

in the directory where this README was extracted to.
